Then, change the DATA_DIR according to the data directory in your computer 
Then, go to MAIN_ALL_Anxiety.m and run the script. This might take a few minutes, while two psychometric functions (vestibular and visual) are being generated for all participants.
The figures will be saved to the "Data" folder (in fig, pdf and tif formats). 
In addition to the separate psychometric functions, a result matrix containing data from all participants (post analysis) is produced, saved in the "All" folder.
Then, open the groupAnalysisAnxietyMixedShira.m script and run it. This file performs further group analysis. The output figures (which accompany the paper) are saved in the "Group" folder.
